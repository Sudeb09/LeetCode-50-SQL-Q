# LeetCode SQL 50 Questions: A Journey to SQL Mastery

-----

I'm embarking on a dedicated journey to significantly enhance my SQL proficiency, and I believe the most effective way to achieve this is through consistent practice and documentation. To that end, I've committed to solving the "SQL 50" study plan problems on LeetCode. This repository serves as a personal log of my progress and a valuable resource for anyone looking to sharpen their SQL skills, from aspiring data professionals to beginners just starting their SQL learning path.

My approach is simple yet effective: **every day, I will solve one LeetCode SQL problem and meticulously document its solution in this GitHub repository.** Each solution will be provided in a clear, well-commented Markdown file, ensuring that the logic and query structure are easily understandable.

This initiative is not just for my personal growth; it's also designed to benefit the broader learning community. By openly sharing my solutions and thought processes, I aim to provide practical examples and insights that can help others navigate the complexities of SQL and build a strong foundation in database querying. Whether you're aiming to ace technical interviews, improve your data analysis capabilities, or simply learn SQL from scratch, I hope this repository proves to be a useful companion on your learning journey.

## Progress Tracker

I will update the badge at the top of this `README.md` to reflect my progress in solving the 50 SQL problems.
This section will eventually contain a more detailed progress bar or status once I've implemented a way to automate its updates.
